Comments from reviewers: 

Dear Dr Moore,

Re: "Small Oscillations via Conservation of Energy" by Troy, Tia; Reiner, Megan; Haugen, Andrew; Moore, Nathan Article reference: PED-101085

We have now received the referee report(s) on your Frontline, which is being considered by Physics Education.

The referee(s) have recommended that you make some amendments to your article. The referee report(s) can be found below and/or attached to this message. You can also access the reports at your Author Centre, at https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/ped-iop

Please consider the referee comments and amend your article according to the recommendations. You should then send us a clean final version of your manuscript. Please also send (as separate files) point-by-point replies to the referee comments and either a list of changes you have made or an additional copy of your manuscript with the changes highlighted. This will aid our referees in reviewing your revised article. Please upload the final version and electronic source files to your Author Centre by 02-Aug-2017.

If we do not receive your article by this date, it may be treated as a new submission, so please let us know if you will need more time.

Should your Frontline,  be accepted for publication we would also like to invite you to create a video abstract to accompany your article, in order to further increase its visibility and impact.

Video abstracts are short, filmed overviews of the main outcomes of your paper and should enable you to go beyond the constraints of your written article to allow you to personally explain the importance of your work to the journal's global audience. Papers with video abstracts often receive more downloads than those papers without.

Full guidelines, including technical specifications, submission details and examples, are available here: http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/videoabstracts

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

Stephanie White

This is worth further consideration.

Referee: 2

COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR(S)
For damping effect, although mentioned in caption of Figure 4 and Figure7, a more detailed and accurate description needs to be made in the first 6 lines of pp.10.

Though the paper is written very well, the last 4 lines of section 4 (l.3-6 in pp.10) need to be rewritten because the sentence is not written in 'international' English...
